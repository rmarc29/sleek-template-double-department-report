# Sleek Template

Sleek Template is a minimal collection of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) packages and settings that ease the writing of beautiful documents. While originally meant for theses, it is perfectly suitable for project reports, articles, syntheses, etc. – with a few adjustments, like margins.

It is composed of four separate packages – `sleek`, `sleek-title`, `sleek-theorems` and `sleek-listings` – each of which can be used individually.

For more information about the packages, settings, environments, commands, etc., please refer to the documentation file [`main.pdf`](main.pdf), which also acts as showcase document.

This template creates another logo, department and faculty. Useful for creating reports for internships (showcasing all the information about both the University you're in and the department that is welcoming you for the internship).
